Team Dionysus, comprised of Enriquez, Polido, and Ramos, is enthusiastically presenting the Energy Consumption Tracker, a cutting-edge solution dedicated to fostering a sustainable and environmentally conscious society. This project is underpinned by the alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. The team aims to empower users to monitor, analyze, and optimize their energy consumption efficiently and conveniently.

The Energy Consumption Tracker is a comprehensive application focused on providing an intuitive platform for users to manage their energy consumption. It enables them to input their energy consumption data periodically, visualize and analyze this data through engaging graphical representations, and set desired or guideline-based energy consumption goals. As a user-centered design, it offers notifications to help users stay on track with their goals and even provides a dedicated section filled with energy-saving tips and best practices.

Key Features:
1. User Registration and Login: Provides a secure system for users to create accounts and securely access the application.
2. Energy Consumption Data Input: Allows users to enter their energy consumption data periodically, like monthly or weekly.
3. Data Visualization and Analysis: Uses charting libraries like JFreeChart or Chart.js to generate visual representations of energy consumption data, enabling easy interpretation and analysis of usage patterns.
4. Goal Setting and Tracking: Enables users to set energy consumption goals based on their desired targets or recommended guidelines and tracks their progress with notifications to encourage goal attainment.
5. Energy Saving Tips: A dedicated section that provides energy-saving tips and best practices to educate users on ways to reduce their energy consumption.
6. Comparative Analysis: Allows users to compare their energy consumption with aggregated data from other users, fostering a sense of competition and motivation to reduce energy usage.
7. Reporting and Recommendations: Generates comprehensive consumption reports highlighting energy usage trends and provides personalized recommendations for optimizing energy efficiency.
8. Integration with Smart Meters: Explores potential integration with smart meters or IoT devices for real-time energy consumption data capture, eliminating the need for manual input and enhancing data accuracy.

The application will potentially integrate with smart meters or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enabling real-time energy consumption data capture. This feature eliminates the need for manual input, enhancing the accuracy of data and the convenience for users. Through this, the application not only tracks energy usage but also positions itself at the forefront of technological advancements in the energy sector.
